# Welcome to the assesment test

### We have 3 objects:
* A User that can either be a student (if it only learns courses), a teacher (if it only teaches)
or a student_teacher if it does both things

* A Program that represents the subject of a course (Eg: Calculus)

* An enrollment that represents the student and the teacher that are in a certain course
